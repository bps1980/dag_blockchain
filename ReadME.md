To discuss the architecture of your blockchain and its transaction processing setup, we can break it down into the following sections. These elements will provide clarity on how the system operates, optimizes, and supports advanced features such as smart contracts, token creation, staking, lending, and flash loans.
________________________________________
1. Blockchain Architecture Overview

DAG-Based Architecture

•	Why DAG?

Your blockchain employs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure instead of a linear chain. This choice offers high throughput, parallel transaction processing, and low latency.

•	Layers: Transactions are grouped into layers based on parent-child dependencies. This helps with dynamic transaction ordering and allows for efficient validation.

•	Key Advantages:

o	Scalability: Handles high transaction volume with ease.
o	Parallelism: Enables parallel processing of non-conflicting transactions.
o	Optimizations: Layer compaction and adaptive bundling reduce overhead.

Consensus Mechanism

•	Leader-Based Voting:

A leader node proposes transactions, and validators perform majority voting. This balances decentralization with efficiency.

•	Optimizations:

o	Validator Load Balancing: Validator tasks are distributed to ensure equal participation and reduced bottlenecks.
o	Fault Tolerance: Backup validators and dynamic leader election maintain uptime in case of node failures.

2. Transaction Processing

Flow of Transactions

1.	Transaction Creation:

o	Users submit transactions via API endpoints.
o	Each transaction includes:

	Receiver and sender information.
	Amount.
	Optional smart contract logic.
	Priority and dependencies (parents).

2.	Validation:

o	Transactions are validated against parent dependencies, digital signatures, and consensus requirements.
o	A cache ensures redundant validations are avoided.

3.	Layer Assignment:

o	Transactions are dynamically assigned to layers based on their parent relationships.
o	Optimizations:

	Compacting empty layers.
	Adaptive bundling for high/low transaction load.

4.	Smart Contract Execution:

o	Transactions with embedded smart contract logic are executed within their assigned layers.
o	Results of contract executions (e.g., state changes) are broadcast to the network.

5.	Storage and Indexing:

o	Processed transactions are stored in a DAG structure.
o	Indexes are maintained for efficient retrieval and query processing.
